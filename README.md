Citybikes rolled to the streets of Helsinki in the summer of 2016. They gained popularity quickly.

This popularity was a nuisance so we made a service to check the availability status on all bike stations. The contributors are: Sampsa Kuronen (backend + web / this repository), Antero Päärni (gfx), Lauri Piispanen ([iOS](https://github.com/lauripiispanen/kaupunkifillarit-ios)) and Hannu Leinonen ([Android](https://github.com/hleinone/kaupunkifillarit-android)).

The data is open data provided by [HSL](http://dev.hsl.fi/).
